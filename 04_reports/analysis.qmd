```{r}
#| message: false
library(tidyverse)

dat <- read_csv(here("01_data", "02_cleaned", "cleaned_data.csv"))
```

## Method

### Participants

```{r}
n_participants <- length(unique(dat$session_id))
demographics <- dat |> 
  group_by(sex) |> 
  summarise(
    n = n()
  )
ages <- dat |> 
  summarise(
    age_m = mean(age),
    age_sd = sd(age),
    age_min = min(age),
    age_max = max(age)
  )
```

`r n_participants` (`r demographics |> filter(sex == "female") |> pull(n)` female and `r demographics |> filter(sex == "male") |> pull(n)` male) participants (aged `r ages$min` - `r ages$max`, *M* = `r ages$age_m`, *SD* = `r ages$age_sd`) were recruited from the crowdsourcing website Prolific Academic and were reimbursed with Â£1,000,000.

## Results

We

```{r}
# fit a two-sample t-test
mod <- t.test(feet ~ condition, data = dat)

# check assumptions
qqnorm(dat$feet) # normality of residuals

mod_nonpar <- wilcox.test(feet ~ condition, data = dat)
```
