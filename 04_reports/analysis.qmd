```{r}
#| echo: false
#| message: false
library(tidyverse)
library(here)

# set digits for reporting in the document when pulling values
options(digits = 2)

# read data
dat <- read_csv(here("01_data", "02_cleaned", "cleaned_data.csv"))

# this uses an anonymous function to round all numeric values
# then makes a column to paste text with values for in-text reporting
# note rounding has to happen in the data file for in-text reporting
# when combining strings and values
desc <- read_csv(here("03_analysis", "descriptives.csv")) |> 
  mutate(
    across(where(is.numeric), \(x) round(x, 2)),
    in_text = paste0("*M* = ", feet_mean, ", *SD* = ", feet_sd)
  )

# read in the model
mod <- read_csv(here("03_analysis", "wilcox_test.csv"))

# set conditionals for in text reporting of p-values
# if the p-value is below .001, it gets < .001, otherwise it gets = .
p_val <- ifelse(mod$p.value < .001, "< .001", paste0("= ", mod$p.value))
```

## Method

### Participants

```{r}
#| echo: false
#| message: false
n_participants <- length(unique(dat$session_id))
demographics <- dat |> 
  group_by(sex) |> 
  summarise(
    n = n()
  )
ages <- dat |> 
  summarise(
    age_m = mean(age),
    age_sd = sd(age),
    age_min = min(age),
    age_max = max(age)
  )
```

`r n_participants` (`r demographics |> filter(sex == "female") |> pull(n)` female and `r demographics |> filter(sex == "male") |> pull(n)` male) participants (aged `r ages$min` - `r ages$max`, *M* = `r ages$age_m`, *SD* = `r ages$age_sd`) were recruited from the crowdsourcing website Prolific Academic and were reimbursed with Â£1,000,000.

## Results

We conducted a Wilcoxon signed-rank test for the estimated feet by condition, which showed larger lengths to be estimated in the large anchor condition (`r desc |> filter(condition == "large_anchor") |> pull(in_text)`) than the small anchor condition (`r desc |> filter(condition == "small_anchor") |> pull(in_text)`), *W* = `r mod$statistic`, *p* `r p_val`.

Here's a plot in @fig-plot-conditions because we can.

```{r}
#| label: fig-plot-conditions
#| fig-cap: "a geet nice plot."
#| echo: false
knitr::include_graphics(here("02_plots", "condition_plot.png"))
